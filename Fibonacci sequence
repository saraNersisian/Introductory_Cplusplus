A Fibonacci sequence of numbers is defined as follows: The first two
numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1.  Then, each additional Fibonacci
number is the sum of the two previous numbers in the sequence.  Thus,
the first ten Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and
34.

Complete the following function so that the function generates the
first fib_num ( fib_num > 2 ) numbers and puts them in the array F.
Do NOT write a recursive function.  Declare any local variable(s) you
need.

  #include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void Fib_general(int F[], int fib_num)
{
	
	F[0] = 0;
	F[1] = 1;

	cout << "\n "<<F[0] << ", " << F[1]<<", ";

	for (int i = 2; i < fib_num; i++)
	{
		F[i] = F[i - 1] + F[i - 2];
		cout << F[i]<<", ";
	}

}

int main()
{
	int fib_num;
	cout << "\n Where you want to stop the Fiboacci sequence? (enter an integer number) ";
	cin >> fib_num;
	

	int *F = new int[fib_num];
	
	
	Fib_general(F, fib_num);

	return 0;
}
