The surface area, S, of a cylinder is given by the formula S = 2 π rl 
where r is the cylinder’s radius, and l is the length of the cylinder. Using this formula, write a C++ function named surfarea() that accepts a cylinder’s radius and length and returns its surface area. 
b. Include the function written in Exercise 6a in a working program. Make sure your function is called from main () and returns a value to main () correctly. Have main () use a cout statement to display the returned value. Test the function by passing various data to it and verifying the returned value. 



#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include <math.h>

using namespace std;

double surfarea(double r, double L)
{
	double SA;
	SA = 2 * M_PI * r * L;

	return SA;
}

int main()
{
	double SurfaceArea;
	double r, L;

	cout << " \n Enter the Radius: ";
	cin >> r;
	cout << "\n Enter the Length: ";
	cin >> L;

	SurfaceArea = surfarea(r, L);

	cout << "\n The volume of the cylinder is " <<SurfaceArea << endl;

	return 0;

}
