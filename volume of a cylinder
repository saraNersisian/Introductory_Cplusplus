The volume, V, of a cylinder is given by the formula V = π r2 L 
where r is the cylinder’s radius and L is its length. Using this formula, write a C++ function named cylvol() that accepts a cylinder’s radius and length and returns its volume.
b. Include the function written in Exercise 5a in a working program. Make sure your function 
is called from main () and returns a value to main () correctly. Have main () use a cout statement to display the returned value. Test the function by passing various data to it and verifying the returned value. 


#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
#include <math.h>

using namespace std;

double cylvol(double r, double L)
{
	double vol;
	vol = M_PI * r * r * L;

	return vol;
}

int main()
{
	double volume;
	double r, L;

	cout << " \n Enter the Radius: ";
	cin >> r;
	cout << "\n Enter the Length: ";
	cin >> L;

	volume = cylvol(r, L);

	cout << "\n The volume of the cylinder is " << volume<<endl;

	return 0;

}
