Problem 2) Many states base yearly car registration fees on an automobile’s model year and weight, using a schedule similar to the following: 

Model Year 	Weight 	Weight Class 	Registration Fee 
1990 or earlier 	Less than 2700 lbs 	1 	26.50 
	2700 to 3800 lbs 	2 	35.50 
	More than 3800 lbs 	3 	56.50 
1991 to 1999 	Less than 2700 lbs 	4 	35.00 
	2700 to 3800 lbs 	5 	45.50 
	More than 3800 lbs 	6 	62.50 
2000 or later 	Less than 3500 lbs 	7 	49.50 
	3500 or more lbs 	8 	62.50 

Using this information, write, compile, and run a C++ program that accepts an automobile’s year and weight and determines and displays its weight class and registration fee. 


#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	double year;
	double weight;

	cout << "\nEnter the year of the car: ";
	cin >> year;

	cout << "\nEnter the weight of the car: ";
	cin >> weight;

	if (year <= 1990)
	{
		if (weight < 2700)
			cout << "\n-Weight class: 1  \n-Fee $26.50";
		if (weight <= 2700 && weight >= 2700)
			cout << "\n-Weight class: 2 \n-Fee $35.50";
		if (weight > 2700)
			cout << "\n-Weight class: 3  \n-Fee $56.50";
	}
	
	else if (year >= 1991 || year <= 1999)
	{
		if (weight < 2700)
			cout << "\n-Weight class: 4 \n-Fee $35.00";
		if (weight <= 2700 && weight >= 2700)
			cout << "\n-Weight class: 5 \n-Fee $45.50";
		if (weight > 2700)
			cout << "\n-Weight class: 6 \n-Fee $62.50";
	}

	else if (year >= 2000)
	{
		if (weight < 2700)
			cout << "\n-Weight class: 7 \n-Fee $49.00";

		 if (weight >= 2700)
			cout << "\n-Weight class: 8 \n-Fee $62.50 ";
	}
	
	cout << "\n\n\n";
	return 0;
