Heron formula for the area, A, of a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c is

A=âˆš([s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] )


s=((a+b+c))/2
Write, test, and execute a function that accepts the values of a, b, and c as parameters in main() as input, and then calculates the values of s and [s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] in a function. If this quantity is positive, the function calculates A. If the quantity is negative, a, b, and c do not form a triangle, and the function should set A = -1. The value of A should be returned by the function. Test the function by passing various data to it and verifying the returned value.

	if (s > 0)

	return A;
