a. Write a function named totamt() that uses four parameters named quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, which represent the number of each of these coins in a piggy-bank. The function should determine the dollar value of the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies passed to it and return the calculated value. 
b. Include the function written in Exercise 2a in a working program. Make sure your function is called from main() and returns a value to main() correctly. Have main() use a cout statement to display the returned value. Test the function by passing various data to it and verifying the returned value. 
#include "pch.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

double totamt(int p, int n, int d, int q)
{
	double totalAmount;
	cout << setprecision(2) << fixed;
	totalAmount = (p*0.01) + (n*0.05) + (d*0.10) + (q*0.25);
	return totalAmount;

}


int main()
{
	int pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters;
	double dollar;

	cout << "\n Enter the quantity of each coin";
	cout << "\n\n  Number of Pennies: ";
	cin >> pennies;
	cout << "  Number of Nickels: ";
	cin >> nickles;
	cout << "  Number of Dimes: ";
	cin >> dimes;
	cout << "  Number of Quarters: ";
	cin >> quarters;

	dollar = totamt(pennies, nickles, dimes, quarters);

	
	cout << "\n The dollar value of your piggy-bank is $" << dollar <<"\n"<< endl;
	return 0;

}
